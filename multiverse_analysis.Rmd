title: "Part 3: Bayesian Meta-analysis of BBS phenotypes"
abstract: 'This is a supplementary file for the paper "Meta-analysis of genotype-phenotype associations in Bardet-Biedl Syndrome uncovers differences among causative genes". Here, we compute how the conclusions of the paper hold under multiple different models. The complete source code for the analysis can be found at https://github.com/martinmodrak/bbs-metaanalysis-bayes or Zenodo, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3243264'

In this part we show how conclusions we discuss in the main paper hold under different model choice`r if(include_validation){" and in the validation dataset" }`. A wide variety of models was tested. Those are briefly described in the comparison. Their exact formulations can be found in Part 2. `r if(include_validation){ "For a discussion of the validation dataset and the overall ability of the model to predict validation data, see Part 3." }`


*Note: For historical reasons the feature of "certain loss of function" (cLOF) as discussed in the data is called just "lof" in most analysis code. This part will thus use "lof" and "cLOF" interchangeably.*

## Defining Precise Criteria

```{r}
min_interesting_effect <- 2
min_phenotypes_for_diffs <- 3
min_bbsome_pairwise_for_diffs <- 5

evaluators <- list()
```

There is some flexibility in defining the exact model configurations consistent with a given conclusion. In general, when discussing whether there is or isn't a difference, the Bayesian model will always say "yes there is a (possibly small) difference" - the posterior probability of a difference of exactly 0 is 0. Instead we choose a threshold of a "clinically relevant effect", which for us is odds ratio outside of (`r 1/min_interesting_effect`,`r min_interesting_effect`) and any effect outside of these bounds is counted as "different".

Similarly, other plain-English statements need to be transformed to an exact predicate that can be considered true or false for a given assignment of numerical values to model coefficients, to let us evaluate its posterior probability.  The exact definition of the individual tested statements follows.


```{r}
n_genes_lof_different <- 5
```

  *	The severity of BBS is worse in patients with LOF mutations than in patients with other mutations. 
    * Ignored for models that do not include LOF.
    * Measured as posterior probability, that the LOF effect is positive (OR > 1) for at least `r n_genes_lof_different` BBSome genes in `r min_phenotypes_for_diffs` phenotypes.

}

A heatmap of posterior probability of statements characterizing individual conclusions. Note that the probability is on logit scale. All Bayesian models include gene as covariate, but may also include additional covariates: source, age, sex, ethnicity or ethnic group, family and certain loss of function (cLOF) - either as a global covariate or by gene. Since age and sex are not available for all data, we can either fit the model only to patients where those are reported (filtered) or impute missing data (imputed). Instead of using cLOF as a covariate, we can fit the model using only patients with cLOF mutations (filtered cLOF). For most models we include a correlation structure across phenotypes (e.g., that two phenotypes occur frequently together across all genes), but this structure may be absent (no corr.) or replaced with a correlation structure across genes (gene corr. - e.g., that two genes have similar pattern of effects across all phenotypes). We also tried modifying the width of prior distributions (wide, narrow, very narrow). See Part 2 of this supplement for a detailed description of all models and the imputation procedure. Dark grey indicates that the question could not be evaluated for the given model (currently only asking for cLOF differences in models that exclude cLOF). The "Problematic fits" category is reserved for models we know do not capture some important variability in the dataset, as discussed in Part 2.

Note: posterior probabilities are clamped to be at least $0.001$ and at most $0.999$ as the sampling scheme used does not let us be very confident in the tails of the distribution. It is possible that with more computational resources some of the posterior probabilities will be more extreme.

Some patterns to notice:

* When fitting filtered datasets, there is less certainty implying less strong evidence in both directions.
* Using very narrow priors on gene coefficients ($N(0,0.1)$, i.e., that almost all odds ratios should be less than $\sim 1.2$) unsurprisingly results in little evidence for directional differences between genes.
* Other than noted above, the conclusions are not sensitive to model choice.

This is a combined plot for both frequentist and Bayesian analysis, once again showing mostly consistent results even when frequentist analyses are taken into account. The only big difference is that some of the HEART and LIV conclusions are not supported by most Bayesian analyses, or only those ignoring between-study variability. `r if(include_validation) { "The same conclusions also fail to hold in the validation dataset, indicating that between-study variability is indeed important."} ` Also, Part 1 discusses some of those conclusions and shows how between-study variability is likely important for them.

`r if(include_validation) { '
Note that the conclusions included here and their exact criteria were set before we had access to the validation dataset.

Let us investigate the inconsistencies between validation data and the main model. First, the claim that BBS4 is the most severe, which we would actually expect NOT to validate, as it is likely false according to our model, but the "BBS4 top odds" conclusion was validated. However, the BBS4 is only present in 5 patients "Elizabeth" source and although it has one of highest odds (taking all phenotypes together for simplicity), it is very similar to the odds for others, so this is comparable to noise level. Also the "among top 3 odds" clause we used is easier to satisfy when not all BBSome genes are present in the validation data: ' }`
